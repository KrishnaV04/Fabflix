EXTRA CREDIT Fuzzy Search:
Our fuzzy search is implemented so it only activates after a user types something of length >= 8 since it's tough to not spell correctly a word less than 8 characters long. The distance is set to 2, so if you search up "Supercroxx" in the Full-Text-Search, "Supercross" will show up in autocomplete and if you do the actual Full-Text-Search.
